[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# :C0111: *Missing docstring*
#   This is far too noisy, ideally we should ignore it in specific places
#   but pylint isn't very good at letting us specify certain rules for certain
#   files
# :W0403: *Relative import %r, should be %r*
#   We don't know where zamboni is going to be running, so relative imports
#   are necessary for now.
# :W0232: *Class has no __init__ method*
# :E1101: *%s %r has no %r member*
#     This is too often wrong to be useful.
# :W0141: *Used builtin function %r*
#     Used when a black listed builtin function is used (see the bad-function
#     option). Usual black listed functions are the ones like map, or filter,
#     where Python offers now some cleaner alternative like list comprehension.
# :W0212: *Access to a protected member %s of a client class*
#     Used when a protected member (i.e. class member with a name beginning
#     with an underscore) is access outside the class or a descendant of the
#     class where it's defined.
# TODO document the rest of the exclusions
